MY (Sean M. PEDERSEN) proofs for the Collatz conjecture are in the PDF file. For any questions contact me on Twitter.

EXISTING PROOFS (I HAVN'T VERIFIED YET):
- https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=115471
  - This proof looks promising but is much too complicated (long) for such a simple and elegant problem IMHO.
- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296682209_Proof_of_the_Collatz_conjecture
  - This "proof" is probabilistic and not absolute. IMO not a full proof.

EXISTING ANTI-PROOF(S):
- https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0312/0312309v19.pdf
  - This one sounds sane, but I just may use the word (math concept) infinity or recursion to circumvent the "hindering" claim that "any proof of the Collatz 3n + 1 Conjecture must have an infinite number of lines; therefore, no formal proof is
possible"... so I am not impressed by this work.
