# CollatzFunk
Analyzium of the Collatz Funk

MY (Sean M. PEDERSEN) proofs for the Collatz conjecture are in the PDF file. For any questions contact me on Twitter.

EXISTING PROOFS (I HAVN'T VERIFIED YET):
- https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=115471
  - This proof looks promising but is much too complicated (long) for such a simple and elegant problem IMHO.
- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296682209_Proof_of_the_Collatz_conjecture
  - This "proof" is probabilistic and not absolute. IMO not a full proof.
