MY (Sean M. PEDERSEN) proofs for the Collatz conjecture are in the PDF file. For any questions contact me on Twitter.

EXISTING PROOFS (I HAVN'T VERIFIED YET):
- https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=115471
  - This proof looks promising but is much too complicated (long) for such a simple and elegant problem IMHO.
- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296682209_Proof_of_the_Collatz_conjecture
  - This "proof" is probabilistic and not absolute. IMO not a full proof.
